# DIY-TaTaCon
Recently I have made a custom diy TaTaCon, similar to the Taiko Force but at a fraction of the cost. Don't expect the same quality as you would from the Taiko Force, but it is an insanely better alternative to the crappy TaTaCon that you find on amazon (It ends up costing the same if you're fine with some manual labor of putting the thing together!)
I am hoping to at least document what I've done here, update on future modifications, as well as put down ideas and alternative builds that I come up with. 


Here is a cost analysis for now:
- 1/2" 24"x48" panel of wood ~$25.90
- Leonardo Arduino $24.99
- 

And if you don't have certain tools available, here's the approximate rental costs from my local Home Depot
-   Jigsaw ~$17 (You can probably get away with a manual saw but a jigsaw will make things a lot easier)
-   Drill ~$16
