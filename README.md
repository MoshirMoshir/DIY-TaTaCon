# DIY TaTaCon
Recently I have made a custom DIY TaTaCon, similar to the TaikoForce but at a fraction of the cost. 
> Don't expect the same quality as you would from the Taiko Force, but in my opinion, it is an insanely better alternative to the TaTaCons that you find on amazon
I am hoping to at least document what I've done here, update on future modifications, as well as put down ideas and alternative builds that I come up with.
