# DIY TaTaCon
Recently I have made a custom DIY TaTaCon, similar to the TaikoForce but at a fraction of the cost. 
> Don't expect the same quality as you would from the Taiko Force, but in my opinion, it is an insanely better alternative to the TaTaCons that you find on amazon
I am hoping to at least document what I've done here, update on future modifications, as well as put down ideas and alternative builds that I come up with. 

## Showcase
So far I have made two TaTaCons, one big that simulates the TaikoForce and Arcade best, and one small that is more conveniant to take around and fit in a backpack or luggage.

### The Big TaTaCon

> Later, I added gum rubber over the black foam, in the future, I would probably just omit the black foam, though it does look cool

### The Small TaTaCon
> Right now it's still in the works. I'll upload the image once it's done
